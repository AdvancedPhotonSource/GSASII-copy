# GitDevG2
Copy of APS svn repository at https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/pyGSAS/trunk. This will not always be in sync 
with the master svn repository, as changes will be made in svn and then will be copied here. Nonetheless developers
are welcome to fork this and offer pull requests in order to communicate possible GSAS-II changes.
